Extract and add the destination folder to the matlab search path. 
Do not add the +SSA folder to the path! That will obscure the package name.

Either use: addpath(<path to dir>);
or navigate to current directory and use: addpath(pwd);
or right click on directory and choose: Add To Path -> Selected Folders (*do not select subfolders)
